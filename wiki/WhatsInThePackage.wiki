#summary Quick overview of what's in the zipfile and how to start building your own multiuser application.

= What's in the package? =

Thank you for your interest in the q42multiplayer engine. This documentation will help you understand the basisc of what you need to do in order to get your own multiuser application up and running.

You can start by either checking out the code from subversion, or download the zipfile.

= Requirements =

All you need is a machine that can host a .NET (2.0 or higher) web site, so any XP machine with IIS will do.

The code itself can be edited using your favorite editor, but it was written with Visual Studio in mind. 

If you're new to Visual Studio, download the free [http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/ Visual Web Developer SP1]. When using VWD, be aware that the solution file provided by the q42multiplayer zipfile (Demo.sln) requires Service Pack 1 of Visual Studio.

= After unzipping =

You see two folders:

 1. Demo (the Demo website, a simple chat application)
 1. Q42.Wheels.Multiplayer (the source code)

And the solution file (Demo.sln). Double click it to open up Visual Studio. You can run the demo website by simply pressing F5, or set up IIS to start the demo website as you see fit.

When you open a browser and surf to the demo website's url (usually http://localhost:SOMEPORT/Demo), you'll see the login page.

 1. Enter a name and press join.
 1. Open up a new browser tab and do the same.
 1. Chat with eachother.
 1. By typing "room anyname" you'll enter a newly created virtual room called "anyname", or any other name you specified. This demonstrates the use of rooms.
 1. To keep track of rooms and users, surf to Status.aspx.
 1. By closing a tab, you'll see the user disconnect.

= The demo code =
The demo project has its own server implemented in the [http://code.google.com/p/q42multiplayer/source/browse/trunk/Demo/app_code/ChatServer.cs app_code/ChatServer.cs] file.
